# Implementation of the educational project "So Long" 
# of School 21(Moscow branch of School 42)

The program implements a 2D collect-it-all type game.
Can work with huge maps using scrolling.
Requires one parameter - a level map with the .ber extension
Valid examples of maps are in the "/maps" folder, invalid ones are in the "/invalidmaps" folder. 
Control the dolphin: w/s - up/down move, a/d - left/right move.
You can finish the game by eating all the fish and going to the exit point. The exit point is inactive until all the fish are eaten.

The project was submitted and defended at school. 
In this implementation, the project does not fully comply with Norminette, but only in a couple of places, somewhat modified, to simplify the code and perception.

The project demonstrates my C programming skills
